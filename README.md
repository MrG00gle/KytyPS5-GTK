**[Weekly updates](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5/discussions/862)** — game progress, recent fixes, and ongoing development.

**[Development on Discord](https://discord.gg/UNrkMqGaBg)** — KytyPS5 development.

KytyPS5 is a free and open-source PlayStation 5 translation layer written in C++ for Linux.
It is based on a heavily modified version of
[Kyty](https://github.com/InoriRus/Kyty). The project is in active development, and behavior
can change significantly between builds.

## Current Status

KytyPS5 can boot 2D and 3D games, including titles built with Unreal Engine
4/5, Unity, and custom engines. External low-level emulation modules are neither required nor
planned.

Development is currently focused on expanding game compatibility and improving boot reliability.

Linux x86-64 is the target platform.

Community game test results are available in the
[KytyPS5 Compatibility List](https://kytyps5.github.io/).

## Bugs and Issues

Compatibility, stability, and performance can vary between versions. You may encounter crashes
or graphical glitches, so please include the version you tested when reporting an issue.

## Contributing

Testing games and submitting detailed bug reports are useful ways to contribute. Search existing
issues first, then use the **Game Emulation Status Report** template and attach the complete log file.

**Pull requests for general fixes, architectural changes, or refactoring that do not address a concrete bug or launch problem in a specific game will be automatically closed.**

**Large, unfocused commits or pull requests that bundle unrelated changes without a clear purpose or game-related benefit will also be automatically closed.**

Keep each PR focused. Name the affected game, describe the exact problem, and provide evidence showing what the change fixes.

Linux is the target platform, so changes should not introduce regressions on Linux. Because KytyPS5 is still evolving quickly, consider
opening an issue before starting a large change.

### Formatting

Set up the clang-format hook after cloning.

Install `pre-commit` using the method appropriate for your platform:

- **Arch Linux / CachyOS:** `sudo pacman -S pre-commit`
- **Other Linux distributions:** `python -m pip install pre-commit`

Then install the Git hook:

```bash
python -m pre_commit install --install-hooks
```

It formats staged `.cpp`, `.h`, and `.inc` files in `src`.

## Developer Information

The PS5 graphics architecture is based on AMD RDNA 2. Use AMD's
[RDNA 2 Instruction Set Architecture Reference Guide (document 70648)](https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/rdna2-shader-instruction-set-architecture)
as the primary instruction-encoding reference when working on shader decoding and recompilation.

Important areas of the codebase:

- [`src/graphics/shader/recompiler`](src/graphics/shader/recompiler) — instruction decoding,
  intermediate representation, control flow, resource tracking, and SPIR-V emission
- [`src/graphics/guest_gpu`](src/graphics/guest_gpu) — PS5 (Prospero) GPU formats and command processing
- [`src/graphics/host_gpu`](src/graphics/host_gpu) — Vulkan host backend and resource management
- [`tests`](tests) — focused memory, shader, and resource-tracking regression tests

The renderer targets Vulkan 1.3. Keep shader changes aligned with both the RDNA 2 ISA semantics and
the Vulkan/SPIR-V validation rules.

## Building

### System requirements

- A current Linux distribution
- A 64-bit x86 processor
- A Vulkan 1.3-capable GPU with current drivers

### Building on Linux

Install the toolchain and the libraries the bundled SDL3 needs. Without the audio, Wayland, and
udev development packages, SDL3 quietly configures itself without those backends, and the resulting
build has no working audio or gamepad hotplug support:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
  clang lld ninja-build cmake git glslang-tools python3 pkg-config \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev \
  libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
  libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols
```

Qt 6 (Concurrent, Network, and Widgets) is required for the launcher. Use your distribution's
packages (`qt6-base-dev`) or an official Qt installation.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B _Build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$Qt6_DIR"

cmake --build _Build/linux --target launcher --parallel
cmake --install _Build/linux --prefix _Build/linux/install
```

The install step copies the Qt libraries and plugins next to the binaries, so
`_Build/linux/install` runs without a matching system Qt installation. FFmpeg is linked statically
from the pinned [KytyPS5 FFmpeg core](https://github.com/KytyPS5/ext-ffmpeg-core)
release, including VP9 and WebM support. System FFmpeg packages are not required.

To build `kyty_emulator` and the `kyty_tests` target without Qt, use a separate build directory:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B _Build/linux-no-qt -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DKYTY_BUILD_LAUNCHER=OFF

cmake --build _Build/linux-no-qt --target kyty_emulator kyty_tests --parallel
```

Clang is required.

The CMake source root is the repository root.

### Building on Fedora and Fedora Atomic (Bazzite, Bluefin, Silverblue)

On regular Fedora, install dependencies on the host. On Fedora Atomic variants such as Bazzite,
Bluefin and Silverblue, use [Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) and run the install and build steps
inside the container. Keep the checkout in your home directory so it is shared with the container.
Add `--nvidia` to the create command for hosts using the proprietary NVIDIA driver:

```bash
distrobox create --name kyty-build --image registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest
distrobox enter kyty-build
```

Install the toolchain, Qt 6 and SDL3 dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
  clang lld ninja-build cmake git glslang python3 pkgconf-pkg-config \
  mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXext-devel libXfixes-devel \
  libXi-devel libXrandr-devel libXScrnSaver-devel libXtst-devel libxkbcommon-devel \
  alsa-lib-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel systemd-devel dbus-devel \
  wayland-devel wayland-protocols-devel qt6-qtbase-devel
```

From the repository root, follow the launcher configure, build and install steps in
[Building on Linux](#building-on-linux), omitting `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$Qt6_DIR"`; CMake finds
Fedora's packaged Qt 6 automatically.

Run `./_Build/linux/install/kyty_launcher` on regular Fedora or inside the container. To launch a
container build from the host, leave the container with `exit`, then run from the repository root:

```bash
distrobox enter kyty-build -- ./_Build/linux/install/kyty_launcher
```

Qt libraries and plugins are bundled. You can also launch directly on a Fedora Atomic host
if its other system libraries are compatible with the container build.

### Regression tests

Build every regression executable and run the registered tests with:

```bash
cmake --build _Build/linux --target kyty_tests
ctest --test-dir _Build/linux --output-on-failure
```

## Running

Update your graphics driver before reporting rendering problems.

To use the graphical launcher:

```bash
./_Build/linux/install/kyty_launcher
```

On first launch, add one or more game folders in the global settings. The launcher searches those
folders recursively for game directories containing `eboot.bin` and ZArchive (`.zar`) game dumps
whose archive root contains `eboot.bin`. Select a detected game and run it from the game list.
ZArchive dumps are mounted read-only and streamed directly; they do not need to be extracted first.

Official release builds include a built-in updater. Leave **Check for updates on startup** enabled,
or click **Check for updates**, then choose **Install Update**. The launcher downloads the package
for your platform from GitHub, checks its SHA-256 checksum, and restarts after installation. Close
any running games first. Settings, saves, patches, and other files outside the release package are
preserved; replacement failures restore the previous files. The installation folder must be writable.
If a package cannot be installed automatically, the updater offers the GitHub release page.
Source builds and builds from forks do not replace themselves with official releases.

The emulator can also be started directly with a legally obtained game directory, ELF file, or
ZArchive dump:

```bash
./_Build/linux/install/kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame"
./_Build/linux/install/kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame.zar"
```

To override the Vulkan loader, set `SDL_VULKAN_LIBRARY`:

```bash
SDL_VULKAN_LIBRARY=/path/to/libvulkan.so.1 ./kyty_emulator --game "/games/ExampleGame"
```

Run `kyty_emulator --help` to see the available graphics, logging, validation, profiling, and
debugging options.

### AI Use

AI tools may be used for research, reverse engineering, and development assistance. Contributors
must fully understand, review, and test all code they submit and remain responsible for its
correctness. Repository communication, including pull-request descriptions, code comments, and
issue comments, must come from the human contributor rather than an autonomous AI agent.

Pull requests that include AI-assisted or AI-generated work should disclose the scope of the AI
involvement and describe the human review and testing performed before submission. Unverified or
untested generated changes may be closed without review.
